"Atmospheric and land fields may be submitted on a (single) grid of the modeling group's choosing.  We expect most groups will elect to save output on the native grid.  If data is ""interpolated"" to a different grid, it is important to preserve certain global mean properties (e.g., the total surface fluxes of heat, momentum, and water mass).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The WGOMD has recommended that all ocean fields be saved on the model's native ocean grid.  Many groups will also elect to save the sea ice fields on the ocean grid.  (The alternative is to save sea ice fields on the atmosphere grid.)  If data is ""interpolated"" from its native grid, it is important to preserve certain global mean properties (e.g., the total surface fluxes of heat, momentum, and water mass into the ocean).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
