"CMOR Table cfSites: ""CFMIP Timestep Station Data"" -- 2-D fields from the Amon table and 3-D fields on model levels sampled at 20 to 30 minute intervals at 73 specified locations for aquaplanet experiments and 119 specified locations for other experiments (see http://cfmip.metoffice.com/cfmip2/pointlocations.txt).  Note that the column labeled ""CMOR dimensions"" indicates that these variables are a function of longitude and latitude.  When writing the data to the netCDF file, however, the axis for the 119 (or 73) locations will be a simple index named ""site"", and CMOR defines this as a ""grid axis"" that has associated longitudes and latitudes. See CMOR documentation for instructions on defining a 1-dimensional grid axis of this kind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The sampling interval should be the integer multiple of the model time-step that is nearest to 30 minutes and divides into 60 minutes with no remainder. e.g. (30->30,20->20,15->30,10->30).   Outputs should be instantaneous (not time mean) and from nearest gridbox (no spatial interpolation.) Note that except for the quantities appearing in the Amon spreadsheet (first line of table below), all other fields are 3-D.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
