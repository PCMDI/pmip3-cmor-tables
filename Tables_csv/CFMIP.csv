"* The years specified for the pre-industrial experiment are relative to the point in the control where expts. 6.1 and 6.3 were initiated.  6.1 and 6.3 should be initiated from the same point in the control run, so that the control run sampled output can be compared directly to each of these runs, and any drift in the control can be accounted for.
