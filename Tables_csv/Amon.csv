"These field are requested only for models in which the pressure can't be calculated from the vertical coordinate information stored already for each variable.  Thus, the pressures on each model level are needed for height or theta-coordinate models, for example, but not sigma- or eta-coordinate models.  The annual cycle climatology (computed from an appropriate segment of the pre-industrial control run) should be reported on model levels and half levels.  DO NOT REPORT ALL MONTHS FOR ALL EXPERIMENTS: Report only 12 months of data representing the climatology of the pre-industrial control run.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
