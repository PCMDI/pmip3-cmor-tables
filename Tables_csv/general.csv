General information,,,
"Except as otherwise noted near each table and summarized in the last two spreadsheets (""CFMIP output"" and ""other output""), each output field should be saved for the entire duration of each and every run.",,,

"The specifications for archiving model output, as described in the following tables, assume the following (please advise us if the assumptions are incorrect): ",,Key,
,,,questions
1. Sea ice fields and ocean biogeochemistry fields will be archived on the same grid as ocean fields.,,,
,,,
2. Land fields (including ice and snow on land) and land biogeochemistry fields will be archived on the same grid as the atmosphere.,,,

The following rules and recommendations for how to  calculate quantities should be followed unless a different method is explicitly indicated in the notes that appear in the following tables.,,,modified between 28 March 2011 and 10 June 2011.
,,,modified after 10 June 2011.
"1. It is recommended that ocean and sea-ice output (including Oclim, Oyr, Omon, and OImon)  be reported on the ocean's native grid.  Unless noted otherwise in the tables, all other output should be reported on the atmospheric grid.",,,
,,,
"2. Unless otherwise specified, the ocean and sea-ice output (including Oclim, Oyr, Omon, and OImon) represents a mean over only the sea portion of each grid cell (i.e., it is interpreted as ""where ocean over ocean""), and a value of 0.0 should be reported where the sea fraction is 0.",,,
,,,
"3. Unless otherwise specified, the land output (in the Lmon and LImon tables) represents a mean over only the land portion of each grid cell (i.e., it is interpreted as ""where land over land""), and a value of 0.0 should be reported  where the land fraction is 0.",,,
,,,
4. The default interpretation of a OImon field is that the  quantity is averaged over the entire ocean portion of each grid-cell (with a value of zero applying anywhere the quantity is absent in this portion of the cell) and then averaged in time.  ,,,

4. The default interpretation of a LImon field is that the  quantity is averaged over the entire land portion of each grid-cell (with a value of zero applying anywhere the quantity is absent in this portion of the cell) and then averaged in time.  ,,,

A note on priorities.,,,
,,,
"The priorities noted in the tables have been largely set by scientists who have participated in model intercomparison activities and have needed these variables in their own research.  Since the priorities in different tables were set by different groups of scientists, the priorities in one table may have a different meaning from the priorities in another table. We hope that the vast majority of fields listed in all the tables will be archived by all the modeling groups, but in many cases where a group has not saved a particular field in the past, this may require non-trivial effort.  The priorities listed here, along with the participating group's expert judgement should be considered when deciding which fields to save.  Please make every effort to save as many of the fields as possible. For lower priority variables, if you can't save them for all the experiments and realizations, please consider saving them for a subset that you think might be of most interest.",,,
